Sales policy (pricing, discounts, approvals)

Purpose
Define pricing, discount approvals, contract terms, and revenue-related rules for sales managers.

Pricing & discounting

- Discounts over 25% require approval from Director of Sales and Finance.

Deal approvals & sign-off
- Deals with custom terms, multi-year commitments over SGD 120,000 ARR, or revenue exceptions must go to Deal Desk review.
- Submit deals using the internal deal form with required fields: deal value, ARR, proposed discount, company, and justification.
- Legal reviews changes to standard terms; allow 48â€“72 business hours.

Trial accounts and credits
- Standard trial length: 30 days. Extensions require manager approval and documentation in CRM.
- Promotional credits must be tracked and reconciled monthly.

Commissions & reporting
- Commissions calculated on net revenue after approved discounts and credits.
- Finance must be consulted for complex revenue recognition.
